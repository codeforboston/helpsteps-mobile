##Introduction:

This is an `ionic-toast` bower component which can be used with any Ionic framework's application.

[View Demo](http://rajeshwarpatlolla.github.io/ionic-toast-demo/demo/ "Demo") 


##Prerequisites.

1) node.js, bower and gulp.

##How to use:

**1)** In your project repository install the ionic-toast using bower

    bower install ionic-toast --save

This will install the latest version released.
    
**2)** Then you can see the following directory structure see in your project folder

Give the path of  `style.css, and ionic-toast.js` in your `index.html` file.

````html
<!-- path to ionic / angularjs files-->
<script src="lib/ionic-toast/dist/ionic-toast.bundle.min.js"></script>
````
    
**3)** In your application module inject the dependency `ionic-toast`, in order to work with the ionic toast.

````javascript
angular.module('mainModuleName', ['ionic', 'ionic-toast']){
 //
}
````

**4)** In your controller, inject 'ionicToast'.

````javascript
.controller('HomeCtrl', ['$scope', 'ionicToast', function($scope, ionicToast) {
  //code here
}])
````

**5)** In your template you can use like below

````html
<button class="button button-block" ng-click="showToast()">Show Toast at top with close</button>
````

**6)** In your controller you have to define a function like below to show the toast

````javascript
$scope.showToast = function(){
<!-- ionicToast.show(message, position, stick, time); -->
  ionicToast.show('This is a toast at the top.', 'top', true, 2500);
};
````

The arguments are as follows. The order of arguments should not be changed.

a) `message` is the first argument, which takes any string message.

b) `position` is the second argument, which takes on of the three values(top, middle, bottom).

c) `stick` is the third argument, which takes either `true` or `false`.
- If the value is true, the toast will not close automatically. It will be closed once you click on the close button.
- If the value is false, the toast will close automatically, after the given time. 

d) `time` is the fourth argument, which takes time in milliseconds. If the value is greater than 5000, then it will be considered as 5000(5 seconds) only.

**7)** In your controller you have to define a function like below to hide the toast

````javascript
$scope.hideToast = function(){
  ionicToast.hide();
};
````


##Screen Shots:

Once you are successfully done with the above steps, you should be able to see the below screen shots.
I have used three buttons here. 

The first screen shot shows only the buttons before clicking on them.
Once you click on the button you should see the remaining screen shots.
